    * If a :0 endPoint is given to a TcpAcceptor, it should         // DONE
        be assigned a different port by the operating system.
        However, NewTcpAcceptor will save the :0 endPoint and
        never change it.  Modify it to correct the port number.

    * TcpConnection.{Read,Write}() should test the connection's
        state
    * TcpConnection.Get{Near,Far}End returns FarEnd and NearEnd
        respectively
    * tcp_server_test succeeds if K=16, N=32 but hangs if N=64

    * Various tcp*.go should rely upon an ip_address abstraction;
        an IPv4 address is OK for now.
