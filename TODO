    * URGENT: tcp_server_test.go HANGs if number of clients (K) and 
        number of messages(N) exceed rather low limits: K=16, N=64
        This is not reported as an error: the test simply hangs.
        - The hang times out after 10 minutes.
    * add a timeout on the test - say 5 seconds

    * Need to verify that 0.0.0.0 (= listen on all interfaces) is       * DONE
        an acceptable address to v4_address.go (line 100)               * DONE
    * NewV4Address must accept [::] as a synonym for 0.0.0.0
    * NewV4Address must accept eg :80 as a synonym for 127.0.0.1:80

    * Implement MockConnection to simplify testing elsewhere

    * The pseudo-constant ANY_TCP_END_POINT is a really bad		        * SKIP
        idea; get rid of it		                                        * SKIP
        - allow TcpConnector.Connect() to take a nil arg		        * SKIP
            instead		                                                * SKIP
    * See tests in msg/ : closing a connection does not change
        its state to DISCONNECTED!
        - BUT this is at the other end of the connection, and
            transport/tcp_connection.GetState() does not 
            examine the state of the underlying connection

    * If a :0 endPoint is given to a TcpAcceptor, it should             * DONE
        be assigned a different port by the operating system.		    * DONE
        However, NewTcpAcceptor will save the :0 endPoint and		    * DONE
        never change it.  Modify it to correct the port number.		    * DONE

    * TcpConnection.{Read,Write}() should test the connection's
        state
    * TcpConnection.Get{Near,Far}End returns FarEnd and NearEnd
        respectively
    * tcp_server_test succeeds if K=16, N=32 but hangs if N=64

    * Various tcp*.go should rely upon an ip_address abstraction;
        an IPv4 address is OK for now.
